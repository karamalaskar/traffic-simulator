# Traffic Simulator 🚦
This command line program is my final project for [C++ programming course at BME](https://infocpp.iit.bme.hu/nhf), the purpose of it is to simulate traffic at an intersection, showcasing object oriented programming. 

## How to run:
1. Compile the program with ```make```
2. Run the program with ```./traffic_simulator```
3. Run the test program with ```./traffic_simulator [simulation_time] [traffic_intensity]```
